# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  # Would be cool to have this but since I'm self hosting this would be a major security hole
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: self-hosted
    
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      # Runs setup.sh in the root of the project directory. 
      - name: Run Setup Script
        run: wsl rm harddrive

      # Lots of copying and pasting since we build for many unreal engine versions
